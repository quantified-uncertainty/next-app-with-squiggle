# Latex demo

This template comes with math markup for free, as you can see: $ f(x) = \{ y | h \circ g (y) > x \} $

Sometimes, we like to put double dollar signs so that latex handles newlining for us

$$ \Cap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} f(n) \neq \emptyset $$

The renderer can be finicky. If you're having trouble, try adding more newlines between your `$$`-enclosed block and your subsequence text block.
