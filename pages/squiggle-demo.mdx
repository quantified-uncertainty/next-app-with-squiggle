# Squiggle demonstration

We can enter in arbitrary, live squiggle code in the `defaultCode` argument of our `SquiggleEditor` component. 

<SquiggleEditor defaultCode={`
x = 1 to 2
y = {a: x, b: 1e1} 
f(t) = normal(t, 1.1)
z = y.b * y.a
f(z)`} /> 

We can also import assignments from files that live in `/public/estimates/` of the repo. 

<SquiggleEditor defaultCode="foo.bar(beta(1,2), ski)" bindingsImportUrl="/estimates/baz.squiggle" />

Files you import for bindings have to consist only of assignments: they cannot end in an expression, unless that expression is a record.
